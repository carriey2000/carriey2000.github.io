The history professor had been his favorite teacher ever since freshman year, and now that he was a senior, it was time for revenge. Jack was known around the campus for his strict grading and dry sense of humor, which often made him seem aloof and intimidating. However, tonight, Tom planned to reveal a different side of Professor Jack.<br>As the night progressed, Jack’s speech became slurred, and his usually composed demeanor began to unravel. His button-down shirt was undone, revealing a muscular chest and a trail of sweat trickling down his bare torso. Jack giggled drunkenly at some inside joke only he understood. Tom took advantage of his state and led him outside, towards an abandoned building on the far end of the campus.<br>Once they were inside, Tom pushed Jack against the cold, hard wall. The professor’s glasses fell off, landing on the dusty floor with a soft thud. He tried to struggle but couldn’t even keep his balance upright. Tom’s hands roamed over Jack’s body, unfastening his pants and boxers until they pooled at his ankles. Jack moaned incoherently, his drunken brain unable to process what was happening.<br>With a sinister smirk, Tom stepped back to admire his work. Professor Jack, the man who had terrified and inspired countless students, was now stripped naked, his pale, hairy legs trembling in the dim light. Tom’s cock throbbed with anticipation as he admired every curve and crease of Jack’s toned body.<br>“Jack, you’ve been such a good student,” Tom purred, his voice laced with malice. “It’s time for your final exam.”<br>He grabbed Jack by the hair and forced his head back, exposing his vulnerable neck. With one swift motion, Tom bit down, leaving a mark that would serve as a reminder of this humiliating night. Jack cried out in pain and shock, but his pleas fell on deaf ears.<br>Tom continued to torment the helpless professor, sucking and licking every inch of his flesh, leaving behind a trail of hickeys and love bites. Jack’s moans turned into whimpers and then into sobs, as the realization of his situation dawned on him.<br>When he judged Jack to be sufficiently broken, Tom picked him up like a ragdoll and carried him to the center of the room. He positioned Jack on his hands and knees, presenting his exposed, vulnerable ass to the world. Tom couldn’t help but admire the way Jack’s ass cheeks quivered with fear and anticipation.<br>Without further ado, Tom positioned himself behind Jack and roughly thrust his hardened cock into the history professor’s tight, resisting ass. Jack screamed in pain and humiliation as Tom pounded away, his cock filling him up completely.<br>As Jack’s body shook uncontrollably from the onslaught of pleasure and pain, Tom whispered crude, degradating words in his ear, relishing in the professor’s complete submission. “You’re my little fucktoy, Jack. My drunk, pathetic fucktoy.”<br>After what felt like an eternity, Tom released his hold on Jack’s hair and pulled out, covering the professor’s back and shoulders with his sticky seed. Jack collapsed, sobbing uncontrollably, as the reality of what had just happened sank in.<br>Tom stepped back to admire his handiwork, a twisted smirk on his face. Professor Jack, the man who once commanded respect and fear, was now nothing but a broken, humiliated mess, naked and exposed for anyone to see.<br>“Good boy, Jack,” Tom purred, his voice laced with satisfaction. “I think you’ve earned an A+ for this assignment.”<br>With that, he turned and walked away, leaving Jack naked and shivering in the cold, empty room, his pride and dignity shattered forever.</p>
